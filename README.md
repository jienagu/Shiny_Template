# Shiny_Template
With some experience of user-research, usage metrics, and product refinement, I learned to deeply understand users requests. This shiny template is to mimic questions/survey type of UI design to bring the best user-experience. 

* Control the possible workflow: Conceal the result page until user answer all of the questions. 
* After they answer all questions, they will directly land on result page.
* User can review their answers in result page.
* Style CSS code included for shiny developer to customize color or theme to meet the requirement of company.
* Reporting system: User can write down their notes and downlaod the result in pdf (please use `noteMD` package: https://github.com/jienagu/noteMD)
